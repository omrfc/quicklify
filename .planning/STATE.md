## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Key decisions archived in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.3]: PlatformAdapter interface established -- v1.4 extends with update() and getLogCommand()
- [v1.4]: figlet is only new dependency (zero-dep, TS-native)
- [v1.4]: Inquirer search via custom filter, not plugin (incompatible with inquirer@12)
- [11-01]: UpdateResult canonical in interface.ts, re-exported from maintain.ts for backward compat
- [11-01]: pollHealth() takes PlatformAdapter arg, not hardcoded to Coolify
- [11-02]: checkCoolifyHealth() kept with @deprecated -- still has callers in health.ts, status.ts, MCP
- [11-02]: Cross-platform log validation: coolify service on dokploy (and vice versa) returns clear error
- [11-02]: MCP serverMaintain update action uses adapter dispatch
- [12-01]: resolveScpPath derives from resolveSshPath -- no separate cache needed
- [12-01]: LANG=C prefix on top/free/df but NOT docker ps
- [12-01]: monitor.ts refactored to use buildMonitorCommand() eliminating duplication
- [12-01]: sshd -T with || cat fallback for audit command
- [13-02]: Static hardcoded completion scripts, not runtime-derived from Commander
- [13-02]: Three separate generator functions for clean shell-specific separation

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns
