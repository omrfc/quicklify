# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-05)

**Brand:** Kastell (kastell.dev | npm: kastell | GitHub: kastelldev)
**Core value:** Autonomous server security and maintenance across multiple cloud providers
**Current focus:** v1.3 Phase 8 -- Platform Adapter Foundation COMPLETE

## Current Position

Phase: 8 of 9 (Platform Adapter Foundation) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase -- COMPLETE
Status: Phase 8 Complete
Last activity: 2026-03-06 -- Plan 08-02 executed: core routing through adapter, requireManagedMode migration

Progress: [██████████] 100% (v1.3 phases 7-8)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 5 (v1.3)
- Average duration: 10min
- Total execution time: 48min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 7. Kastell Rebrand | 3/3 | 33min | 11min |
| 8. Platform Adapter Foundation | 2/2 | 15min | 7.5min |
| 9. Dokploy Adapter | 0/? | - | - |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Adapter pattern for platform abstraction (not mode expansion)
- GitHub repo transfer deferred to post-v1.3
- Dokploy restore deferred to v1.5
- Apache 2.0 license (patent protection)
- Dokploy npm SDK rejected (beta, unnecessary risk)
- Rebrand before adapter work (avoid double rename)
- isSafeMode() checks KASTELL_SAFE_MODE first, falls back to QUICKLIFY_SAFE_MODE with deprecation warning
- Migration copies entire directory recursively for forward-compat
- Deprecation warning uses process.stderr.write to avoid MCP stdout pollution
- Linode snapshot filter uses dual-prefix (kastell- || quicklify-) for backward compat
- GitHub org URLs updated from omrfc/quicklify to kastelldev/kastell in deploy.ts
- NOTICE file added to package.json files array for Apache 2.0 npm distribution
- Repository URL kept as omrfc/quicklify in package.json (repo transfer post-v1.3)
- PlatformAdapter interface uses import type for BackupManifest (avoids circular dependency)
- CoolifyAdapter duplicates existing logic intentionally (Plan 02 will rewire core modules)
- isBareServer reimplemented to use resolvePlatform() for consistent normalization
- requireCoolifyMode kept as backward compat alias calling requireManagedMode
- mode fields marked @deprecated in JSDoc while keeping full backward compat
- deploy.ts and provision.ts derive platform from mode at call site (not via resolvePlatform for new records)
- backup.ts createBackup delegates entirely to CoolifyAdapter, other exports preserved for backward compat
- status.ts uses resolvePlatform + getAdapter for health check routing (handles legacy mode normalization)
- All 5 requireCoolifyMode call sites switched to requireManagedMode (same behavior, clearer intent)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 9: Dokploy backup completeness and API key timing need live instance verification
