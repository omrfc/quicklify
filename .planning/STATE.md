Progress: [██████████] 100% (Phase 7)

## Performance Metrics

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Adapter pattern for platform abstraction (not mode expansion)
- GitHub repo transfer deferred to post-v1.3
- Dokploy restore deferred to v1.5
- Apache 2.0 license (patent protection)
- Dokploy npm SDK rejected (beta, unnecessary risk)
- Rebrand before adapter work (avoid double rename)
- isSafeMode() checks KASTELL_SAFE_MODE first, falls back to QUICKLIFY_SAFE_MODE with deprecation warning
- Migration copies entire directory recursively for forward-compat
- Deprecation warning uses process.stderr.write to avoid MCP stdout pollution
- Linode snapshot filter uses dual-prefix (kastell- || quicklify-) for backward compat
- GitHub org URLs updated from omrfc/quicklify to kastelldev/kastell in deploy.ts
- NOTICE file added to package.json files array for Apache 2.0 npm distribution
- Repository URL kept as omrfc/quicklify in package.json (repo transfer post-v1.3)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 9: Dokploy backup completeness and API key timing need live instance verification
