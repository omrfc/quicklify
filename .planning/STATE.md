# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-09)

**Brand:** Kastell (kastell.dev | npm: kastell | GitHub: kastelldev)
**Core value:** Autonomous server security and maintenance across multiple cloud providers
**Current focus:** v1.6 Phase 23 - Infrastructure Foundation (COMPLETE)

## Current Position

Phase: 23 of 27 (Infrastructure Foundation) — first of 5 v1.6 phases
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase (PHASE COMPLETE)
Status: Phase 23 complete
Last activity: 2026-03-09 — Completed 23-03 (provider retry integration)

Progress: [██████████] 100% (Phase 23)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3 (v1.6)
- Average duration: 9min
- Total execution time: 26min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 23 | 3/3 | 26min | 9min |

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 24 P01 | 4 | 1 tasks | 3 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v1.6/v1.7 split: Audit+Evidence+Altyapi first (v1.6), Guard Core second (v1.7)
- Dokploy API integration v1.8+'ya ertelendi
- Risk trend v1.7'ye birlestirildi (guard ile birlikte mantikli)
- Zero new production dependencies for v1.6 (research confirmed)
- Custom mkdir lock over proper-lockfile (CJS-only, ESM-incompatible)
- Custom withRetry() HOF over axios-retry (avoid global interceptor conflicts)
- Infrastructure before features (file locking prerequisite for snapshot/evidence writes)
- withFileLock uses synchronous mkdirSync/rmdirSync for atomic lock operations, async only for retry delay
- withRetry parses Retry-After as integer first, then Date.parse, then falls back to exponential backoff
- withProviderErrorHandling(() => withRetry(...)) composition for provider GET methods
- getSnapshotCostEstimate treated as GET method (reads server disk info, retryable)
- Mode migration persists atomically on first getServers read (no lazy fallback at each call site)
- All config/audit writes wrapped with withFileLock for concurrency safety
- [Phase 24]: Test file placed at tests/unit/ (not src/__tests__/) to match Jest roots configuration
- [Phase 24]: Zod literal(1) for schemaVersion to explicitly reject unknown schema versions at parse time

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
