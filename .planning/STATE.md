# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-09)

**Brand:** Kastell (kastell.dev | npm: kastell | GitHub: kastelldev)
**Core value:** Autonomous server security and maintenance across multiple cloud providers
**Current focus:** v1.6 Phase 23 - Infrastructure Foundation (COMPLETE)

## Current Position

Phase: 25 of 27 (Audit Diff & Compare) — third of 5 v1.6 phases
Plan: 1 of 2 complete in current phase
Status: Phase 25 in progress (Plan 01 complete, Plan 02 next)
Last activity: 2026-03-11 — Completed 25-01 (audit diff engine)

Progress: [████████--] 80% (Phase 25 plan 1/2)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3 (v1.6)
- Average duration: 9min
- Total execution time: 26min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 23 | 3/3 | 26min | 9min |

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 24 P01 | 4 | 1 tasks | 3 files |
| Phase 24-audit-snapshots P02 | 12 | 2 tasks | 3 files |
| Phase 25 P01 | 15min | 2 tasks | 3 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v1.6/v1.7 split: Audit+Evidence+Altyapi first (v1.6), Guard Core second (v1.7)
- Dokploy API integration v1.8+'ya ertelendi
- Risk trend v1.7'ye birlestirildi (guard ile birlikte mantikli)
- Zero new production dependencies for v1.6 (research confirmed)
- Custom mkdir lock over proper-lockfile (CJS-only, ESM-incompatible)
- Custom withRetry() HOF over axios-retry (avoid global interceptor conflicts)
- Infrastructure before features (file locking prerequisite for snapshot/evidence writes)
- withFileLock uses synchronous mkdirSync/rmdirSync for atomic lock operations, async only for retry delay
- withRetry parses Retry-After as integer first, then Date.parse, then falls back to exponential backoff
- withProviderErrorHandling(() => withRetry(...)) composition for provider GET methods
- getSnapshotCostEstimate treated as GET method (reads server disk info, retryable)
- Mode migration persists atomically on first getServers read (no lazy fallback at each call site)
- All config/audit writes wrapped with withFileLock for concurrency safety
- [Phase 24]: Test file placed at tests/unit/ (not src/__tests__/) to match Jest roots configuration
- [Phase 24]: Zod literal(1) for schemaVersion to explicitly reject unknown schema versions at parse time
- [Phase 24-audit-snapshots]: saveSnapshot returns void (not Promise<string>), success message uses server name not file path
- [Phase 24-audit-snapshots]: listSnapshots is async in snapshot.ts, awaited in audit command (plan showed sync)
- [Phase 24-audit-snapshots]: Audit command snapshot tests placed at tests/unit/ (not src/commands/__tests__/) per Jest roots config
- [Phase 25]: diffAudits keys on check.id for canonical cross-audit check matching
- [Phase 25]: resolveSnapshotRef: filename-first then name-scan for unambiguous ref resolution

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
