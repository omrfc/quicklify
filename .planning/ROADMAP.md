### 🚧 v1.3 Kastell Rebrand + Dokploy Adapter (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Rename quicklify to kastell across entire codebase, switch to Apache 2.0 license, and add Dokploy as a second platform adapter alongside Coolify.

- [x] **Phase 7: Kastell Rebrand** - Quicklify identity fully replaced with Kastell across CLI, packages, config, docs, and CI
- [x] **Phase 8: Platform Adapter Foundation** - Adapter abstraction layer established, existing Coolify logic extracted into adapter pattern with zero behavior change
- [ ] **Phase 9: Dokploy Adapter** - Dokploy servers can be provisioned, monitored, and backed up through CLI and MCP

## Phase Details

### Phase 7: Kastell Rebrand
**Goal**: Users interact with a CLI called `kastell`, all references to "quicklify" are replaced, config paths are migrated, and the package is published under the new name with Apache 2.0 license
**Depends on**: Phase 6 (v1.2.1 complete)
**Requirements**: BRAND-01, BRAND-02, BRAND-03, BRAND-04, BRAND-05, BRAND-06, BRAND-07, BRAND-08, BRAND-09, BRAND-10
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Running `kastell --version` prints the version and `kastell init` starts provisioning — the CLI binary is `kastell`, not `quicklify`
  2. Config is read from `~/.kastell/` and if `~/.quicklify/` exists, its contents are automatically copied to `~/.kastell/` on first run without data loss
  3. `grep -ri "quicklify" src/` returns zero hits (excluding historical CHANGELOG entries), and all test files reference "kastell"
  4. LICENSE file contains Apache 2.0 text, NOTICE file exists, and README/docs reflect the Kastell brand and license
  5. `npm info kastell version` returns `1.3.0` and `npm info quicklify deprecated` shows the deprecation message pointing to kastell
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — Foundation: types, config paths, env vars, migration logic
- [x] 07-02-PLAN.md — Source + tests: remaining src/ string replacements and all test updates
- [x] 07-03-PLAN.md — Packaging + docs: bin scripts, package.json, license, documentation

### Phase 8: Platform Adapter Foundation
**Goal**: A `PlatformAdapter` interface exists, existing Coolify functionality is extracted into `CoolifyAdapter` with zero behavior change, and core modules route through the adapter factory
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Requirements**: ADAPT-01, ADAPT-02, ADAPT-03, ADAPT-04, ADAPT-05, ADAPT-06, ADAPT-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `PlatformAdapter` interface is defined with cloudInit, healthCheck, backup, and status methods, and a `getAdapter(platform)` factory returns the correct adapter
  2. All existing Coolify operations (provision, status, backup) work identically through `CoolifyAdapter` — no user-facing behavior change
  3. `ServerRecord` accepts an optional `platform` field, legacy records without it default to `"coolify"`, and `getServers()` normalizes them
  4. Mode guard checks are platform-aware (`requireManagedMode()` works for both coolify and dokploy platforms)
  5. All 2099+ existing tests pass with zero regressions after the adapter extraction
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 08-01-PLAN.md — Adapter layer: types, PlatformAdapter interface, CoolifyAdapter, factory, modeGuard evolution
- [x] 08-02-PLAN.md — Core routing: deploy/provision/status/backup through adapter, requireManagedMode migration

### Phase 9: Dokploy Adapter
**Goal**: Users can provision, health-check, and back up Dokploy servers through the same CLI commands and MCP tools used for Coolify, selecting Dokploy via `--mode dokploy` or interactive menu
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Requirements**: DOKP-01, DOKP-02, DOKP-03, DOKP-04, DOKP-05, DOKP-06, DOKP-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `kastell init --mode dokploy --provider hetzner` provisions a server with Dokploy installed via cloud-init, and the server record stores `platform: "dokploy"`
  2. `kastell status` on a Dokploy server checks health via port 3000 HTTP probe and reports server status
  3. `kastell backup` on a Dokploy server copies `/etc/dokploy` and PostgreSQL dump via SSH+SCP to the local machine
  4. MCP tools accept `mode: "dokploy"` and correctly route Dokploy server operations through `DokployAdapter`
  5. Running `kastell` without arguments shows the interactive menu with a platform selection option for Dokploy
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 09-01-PLAN.md — DokployAdapter implementation + factory registration + unit tests
- [ ] 09-02-PLAN.md — CLI/MCP integration: deploy, provision, backup routing, interactive menu, MCP schema
