### 🚧 v1.8 Fleet + Notifications (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Multi-server fleet visibility, multi-channel alert notifications for guard/doctor, doctor auto-remediation with per-finding interactive confirmation, and structural tech debt cleanup — making Kastell operationally complete for multi-server environments.

## Phase Details

### Phase 34: Layer Violation Fix
**Goal**: The core layer is clean — no upward imports from commands/
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v1.8)
**Requirements**: DEBT-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `core/deploy.ts` imports only from `core/` and `utils/` — no imports from `commands/`
  2. `kastell provision` and all dependent commands behave identically before and after the fix
  3. Full test suite passes with zero new failures
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 34-01-PLAN.md — Move firewallSetup/secureSetup to core/ and update test mocks

### Phase 35: Adapter Deduplication
**Goal**: Adapter backup/restore duplication eliminated via shared utilities
**Depends on**: Phase 34
**Requirements**: DEBT-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `adapters/shared.ts` contains the common backup/restore template helpers used by both adapters
  2. `adapters/coolify.ts` and `adapters/dokploy.ts` call shared helpers — no ~80% duplicate code blocks remain
  3. All adapter conformance tests pass with no behavior change
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 36: Notification Module
**Goal**: Users can configure and test multi-channel notifications before guard wires them in
**Depends on**: Phase 35
**Requirements**: NOTF-01, NOTF-02, NOTF-03, NOTF-04, NOTF-05, NOTF-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can add Telegram, Discord, and Slack channel configs to `~/.kastell/notify.json` via documented YAML fields and the file is written at mode 0o600
  2. `kastell notify test telegram` (and discord, slack) sends a real message to the configured channel and reports success or failure
  3. A single `dispatchNotification()` call fans out to all configured channels simultaneously; one channel failure does not block others
  4. Sending the same alert twice within 30 minutes for the same server and finding type produces only one outbound notification
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 37: Doctor Fix
**Goal**: Users can remediate doctor findings interactively with full control over what executes
**Depends on**: Phase 35 (clean core, no dependency on Phase 36)
**Requirements**: DFIX-01, DFIX-02, DFIX-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `kastell doctor --fix` prompts the user once per finding before executing any SSH command on the server
  2. `kastell doctor --fix --force` skips all confirmation prompts and executes all fix commands without interaction
  3. `kastell doctor --fix --dry-run` prints each fix command next to its finding without executing any SSH command
  4. Skipping a finding in interactive mode leaves that finding unfixed and continues to the next one without aborting
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 38: Fleet Visibility
**Goal**: Users can see all registered servers' health and security posture in one table
**Depends on**: Phase 34 (clean core layer)
**Requirements**: FLEET-01, FLEET-02, FLEET-03, FLEET-04, FLEET-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `kastell fleet` displays a table with health status and cached audit score for every registered server in under 10 seconds regardless of server count
  2. An unreachable server renders an OFFLINE row with an error reason — it does not crash the command or hide the server from the table
  3. `kastell fleet --json` outputs machine-readable JSON with the same data as the table
  4. `kastell fleet --sort score` (and name, provider) reorders the table rows accordingly
  5. Claude can retrieve fleet data via the `server_fleet` MCP tool
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 39: Guard Notification Integration
**Goal**: Guard breach detections trigger real notifications through all configured channels
**Depends on**: Phase 36 (notification module must exist first)
**Requirements**: NOTF-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. When guard detects a breach (disk/RAM/CPU threshold exceeded or audit score regression), a notification is dispatched to all configured channels from the user's machine
  2. Guard credentials are never written into the VPS guard script — dispatch happens client-side after `kastell guard status` reads the remote breach log
  3. Repeated breaches of the same type on the same server within the cooldown window produce only one notification, not one per guard cron run
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 40: Shell Completions + Polish
**Goal**: All v1.8 commands and flags are discoverable via tab completion and codebase is structurally clean
**Depends on**: Phases 36, 37, 38, 39 (all command signatures must be finalized first)
**Requirements**: DEBT-03, DEBT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Tab completion for bash, zsh, and fish includes `fleet`, `notify`, and the `--fix`, `--force`, `--sort` flags added in v1.8
  2. `audit` and `evidence` commands and their flags (`--schedule`, `--trend`, `--days`) are present in completion scripts
  3. `postSetup` is decomposed into separate bare and platform functions with no behavioral change to provisioning
**Plans**: TBD
