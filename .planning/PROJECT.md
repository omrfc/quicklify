# Kastell

## What This Is

Kastell is the autonomous security and maintenance layer for modern self-hosted infrastructure. CLI tool and MCP server that secures, monitors, audits, and maintains servers on cloud VPS providers (Hetzner, DigitalOcean, Vultr, Linode). Supports Coolify-managed, Dokploy-managed, and bare (generic) servers with full platform parity. Full lifecycle: provisioning, security hardening, security auditing (46 checks, 9 categories), domain management, firewall, backups, snapshots, monitoring, and maintenance — all from a single command line or via Claude AI integration. OS keychain token security with buffer storage. Branded interactive TUI with search-based navigation.

**Positioning:** Coolify deploys. Docker runs. Kastell protects.

## Core Value

Autonomous server security and maintenance across multiple cloud providers. Guard is the core product, Provision is complementary.

### Active

<!-- Next milestone: v1.7 Guard Core -->

- [ ] `kastell guard` — autonomous security monitoring daemon
- [ ] `kastell lock --production` — one-command server hardening
- [ ] `kastell fleet` — multi-server visibility
- [ ] `kastell doctor` — proactive operations intelligence
- [ ] Multi-channel notifications (Telegram/Discord/Slack/Email)
- [ ] Backup scheduling (`backup --schedule`)
- [ ] Risk trend with cause analysis

### Planned (Kastell Roadmap)

- **v1.7** — Guard Core: `kastell guard`, `kastell lock`, `kastell fleet`, `kastell doctor`, bildirimler, backup --schedule, risk trend
- **v2.0** — Plugin ekosistemi (Claude Code marketplace + cross-platform SKILL.md)
- **v3.0** — Web dashboard (premium) + managed servis ($49/$99/$299+)

### Out of Scope

- AI/ML based predictions — use simple thresholds + cron instead
- Manual/no-API providers (Nodesty, OVH manual) — no cloud API = no Kastell value
- Being a container runtime, deployment platform, or OS — Kastell is security + maintenance only

## Context

- **Brand**: Kastell (kastell.dev, npm: kastell, GitHub: kastelldev)
- **Current npm**: `kastell` v1.5.2 published, `quicklify` deprecated
- 25 CLI commands + 9 MCP tools (incl. `kastell audit`, `kastell evidence`, `server_audit`, `server_evidence`)
- 2687 tests across 124 suites (95%+ coverage)
- CI: GitHub Actions (3 OS x 2 Node versions = 6 matrix)
- Codebase: ~18,850 LOC TypeScript
- Architecture: Commands (thin wrappers) -> Core (business logic) -> Providers (plugin) / Adapters (platform)
- Supports three server modes: `coolify` (default), `dokploy`, and `bare` (generic VPS)
- v1.6 shipped: audit snapshots/diff/compare, forensic evidence, infrastructure hardening, adapter docs
- **Target audience**: Indie hackers (Y1) -> Micro-DevOps teams (Y2) -> SaaS compliance (Y3)

### CLAUDE.md Yapisi (2026-03-05 yeniden yapilandirildi)
IF-ELSE router pattern uygulandi — context bloat onleme:
- **Global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`** (32 satir): Router — durustluk + compaction kurtarma + kural yonlendirici
- **`~/.claude/rules/`** (8 dosya): coding, git, security, post-task, research, subagent, contract, learning
- **`~/.claude/lessons/global.md`**: Global lessons learned
- **Kastell `CLAUDE.md`** (57 satir): Tech stack + skill routing + architecture + conventions
- **Kastell `.claude/skills/`** (5 dosya): cli-command, mcp-tool, provider, publish, testing
- Kurallar kosullu yukleniyor — her oturumda sadece gerekli dosyalar okunur

## Constraints

- **Node.js**: 20+ required (engines field in package.json)
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing CLI commands must not break
- **npm package**: Must remain publishable, no breaking changes to bin entries
- **SSH dependency**: Server operations require SSH client on user machine
- **Provider APIs**: Rate limited, operations must be idempotent where possible

## Key Decisions

| withProviderErrorHandling + extractApiMessage callback | Single error pattern for 4 providers with provider-specific message extraction | ✓ Good — v1.6 |
| isServerMode type guard over `as ServerMode` | Runtime validation prevents invalid string propagation | ✓ Good — v1.6 |
| GitHub repo transfer deferred | Less risk, do after npm publish is stable | — Pending |

## Kastell Command Architecture (Future)

| Command | Purpose | Version |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `kastell audit` | Free security scan + actionable fix commands | v1.5 |
| `kastell lock --production` | One-command server hardening | v2.0 |
| `kastell guard` | Autonomous security daemon | v2.0 |
| `kastell fleet` | Multi-server visibility | v2.0 |
| `kastell doctor` | Proactive operations intelligence | v2.0 |
| `kastell provision` | Server provisioning (current Quicklify) | v1.3 |
| `kastell uninstall` | Clean removal (trust guarantee) | v2.0 |
| `kastell dashboard` | Web UI monitoring (premium) | v3.0 |

## Strategic Principles

- **Guard = heart, Provision = entry point.** Provision is removable, Guard is not
- **Audit = growth engine.** Guard brings revenue, Audit brings distribution
- **Litmus test**: "If Provision disappeared tomorrow, would Kastell still be valuable?" → Deepen Guard until the answer is yes
- **No FUD**: Facts + Fix + Command. No fear-based marketing
- **No AI/ML**: Simple statistics + threshold + cron. Deterministic > magical
- **No feature creep**: Minimal, reliable, predictable
- **Security = Core**: Maintenance = security sustainability, Monitoring = security visibility
- **Open source**: Non-negotiable for root-access trust
- **`--dry-run` everywhere**: Trust barrier solution
- **Dashboard**: Local-first → self-hosted optional → SaaS last (root-access trust)
- **Risk trend**: Always with "why" — trend without cause is meaningless
- **Lifestyle vs infra company**: Decide after Year 1 traction, not now

## Market Analysis (2026-03-04)

**No direct competitor exists.** No single tool covers Kastell's full position (provision + guard + audit + fleet + multi-provider + CLI + MCP).

Partial competitors:
- **Lynis** (cisofy.com/lynis): `lynis audit system` → score 0-100. Audit only, no fix, no guard. **Reference for kastell audit**
- **CrowdSec**: Real-time threat detection only. No provision/backup/maintenance
- **Netdata**: Monitoring dashboard only. Observes, doesn't act
- **Fail2Ban**: Brute force blocking only. One piece of kastell lock
- **Nixopus**: VPS management + deploy. Weak security layer
- **Ansible/Chef/Puppet**: Infra automation for DevOps teams. Too complex for indie hackers

**Kastell's differentiator**: Detect → Decide → Act → Report. **Autonomous.** Others either just report or solve only one piece.

**Market gap**: "I have a server, make it secure and maintained with one command" — nobody fills this for indie hackers.

## Guard Autonomous Architecture (v2.0)

Guard runs as a daemon on the server (cron-based, no AI):
- Health checks every 5 min
- Auto backup on schedule
- Disk/RAM alerts at threshold (e.g., disk > 80%)
- Docker cleanup (docker system prune)
- Auto security patches (unattended-upgrades)
- Multi-channel notifications (Telegram/Discord/Slack/Email)
- Risk trend with "why": `Risk: 62 → 68 ↑` + cause list

All simple statistics + cron. No AI/ML. Deterministic and predictable.

## Brand & Messaging

- **Technical slogan** (website): "Your infrastructure, fortified."
- **Social slogan** (X/indie): "Self-hosting is freedom. Kastell makes it safe."
- **Enterprise term** (future): "Infrastructure Integrity Layer" — not for Year 1
- **Positioning**: Coolify deploys. Docker runs. Kastell protects.

## Current Milestone: v1.7 Guard Core

**Goal:** Build autonomous security monitoring, one-command hardening, multi-server fleet visibility, and proactive operations intelligence with multi-channel notifications.

**Target features:**
- `kastell guard` — autonomous security monitoring daemon
- `kastell lock --production` — one-command server hardening
- `kastell fleet` — multi-server visibility
- `kastell doctor` — proactive operations intelligence
- Multi-channel notifications (Telegram/Discord/Slack/Email)
- Backup scheduling (`backup --schedule`)
- Risk trend with cause analysis
