## Security Architecture

### Token Handling (A2 — Sensitive Data Exposure)
- Token resolution chain: OS keychain (primary) -> environment variable (fallback) -> undefined
- Supported env vars: `HETZNER_TOKEN`, `DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN`, `VULTR_TOKEN`, `LINODE_TOKEN`
- `kastell auth set <provider>` stores tokens in OS keychain (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service)
- Tokens are never written to disk in plaintext
- API tokens collected via interactive secure prompts (masked input) when neither keychain nor env var is available
- `sanitizedEnv()` strips all keys containing TOKEN, SECRET, PASSWORD, CREDENTIAL from child process environments before every `spawn`/`spawnSync`/`exec` call
- Provider errors sanitized via `stripSensitiveData()` — removes Authorization headers, request data, response headers, and non-whitelisted response body fields from axios errors before they propagate via error cause chains

### Input Validation (A1 — Injection)
- All shell execution uses `spawn`/`spawnSync` with array arguments (never string interpolation into shell commands)
- `assertValidIp()` — IPv4 format and octet range (0-255) validation applied before every SSH/SCP connection and before ssh-keygen calls (defense-in-depth)
- `assertSafePath()` — rejects remote SCP paths containing shell metacharacters (`;`, `|`, `&`, `$`, `` ` ``, `(`, `)`, `<`, `>`, newlines, spaces)
- Server name validation: 3-63 chars, lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens, must start with letter
- `buildHardeningCommand()` — SSH port option validated as integer in range 1-65535 before interpolation into sed command
- `buildDockerHardeningCommand()` — JSON settings passed to jq via stdin pipe (`printf '%s' | jq -s`), never via shell string interpolation
- `buildSshCipherCommand()` — sshd_config validated with `sshd -t` before restart; automatic rollback on failure
- YAML config: 22+ security key patterns detected and warned
- MCP tools: Zod schema validation on all inputs (port ranges, provider enums, backup ID regex)

### SSH & Network Security
- `StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new` for initial connections (first connect accepts key, subsequent connections verify)
- `BatchMode=yes` on non-interactive SSH (prevents stdin hijacking — critical for MCP mode)
- `ConnectTimeout=10` and 30s exec timeout prevent hanging connections
- Stale host key auto-removal with IP re-validation before `ssh-keygen -R` calls
- SSRF defense: `assertValidIp()` on all Coolify health check targets

### File System Security (A5 — Security Misconfiguration)
- Config directory (`~/.kastell/`) created with `0o700` permissions (owner only)
- Server config file written with `0o600` permissions (owner read/write only)
- Backup directories created with `0o700` permissions
- Backup manifest files written with `0o600` permissions
- Export files written with `0o600` permissions
- Cloud-init install log restricted to `chmod 600` (root only)

### Error Handling & Data Exposure
- `getErrorMessage()` returns only `error.message` — never exposes stack traces to users
- `sanitizeStderr()` redacts home directory paths, IP addresses, `password=`, `token=`, `secret=` patterns from SSH stderr output (200 char limit)
- MCP error responses use `getErrorMessage()` — no stack trace disclosure

### Path Traversal Protection (A5)
- Backup restore: `backupId` regex validation + `path.resolve()` guard ensures backup path stays within the server's backup directory
- Remote SCP paths validated by `assertSafePath()` before use

### Access Control (A3 — Broken Access Control)
- **SAFE_MODE** (`KASTELL_SAFE_MODE=true`, default enabled for MCP) blocks destructive operations: `destroy`, `restore`, `snapshot-delete`, `provision`, `restart`, `maintain`, `snapshot-create`
- Mode guard (`requireCoolifyMode()`) prevents Coolify-specific operations on bare servers

### Import/Export Security
- Sensitive field stripping on import
- Strict file permissions on export
- Format validation with field-level checking
- Duplicate detection by server ID

## Dependency Security

### Production Dependencies (0 known vulnerabilities)
```
npm audit --omit=dev → found 0 vulnerabilities
```

All production dependencies use audited, versioned packages:
- Hetzner Cloud API v1 (via Axios, HTTPS)
- DigitalOcean API v2 (via Axios, HTTPS)
- Vultr API v2 (via Axios, HTTPS)
- Linode API v4 (via Axios, HTTPS)
- Model Context Protocol SDK (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`) for MCP server
- Zod for runtime input validation
- Coolify installed via download-then-execute pattern: `curl -fsSL URL -o /tmp/install.sh && bash /tmp/install.sh` (prevents partial execution on network failure)

### Dev Dependencies
No known vulnerabilities (minimatch pinned to ^10.2.4 via npm overrides).

## Token Security

### OS Keychain Integration

Kastell stores provider API tokens in the OS keychain using `@napi-rs/keyring`:

- **Windows:** Windows Credential Manager
- **macOS:** Keychain
- **Linux:** Secret Service (GNOME Keyring, KWallet)

Use `kastell auth set <provider>` to store tokens securely. Use `kastell auth list` to see which providers have stored tokens (token values are never displayed). Use `kastell auth remove <provider>` to delete a stored token.

In CI/headless environments where no keychain is available, Kastell automatically falls back to environment variables.

### Subprocess Security

All child processes spawned by Kastell use `sanitizedEnv()` which strips TOKEN, SECRET, PASSWORD, and CREDENTIAL environment variables. This prevents accidental token leakage to SSH sessions and other subprocesses.

### Disabling Core Dumps (Recommended for MCP/Long-Running Mode)

Core dumps can expose in-memory tokens. Disable on production servers:

**Linux:**
- `ulimit -c 0` (current session)
- `echo "* hard core 0" >> /etc/security/limits.conf` (permanent)

**macOS:**
- `launchctl limit core 0 0`

### Swap Encryption (Recommended)

Unencrypted swap can expose in-memory tokens when pages are swapped to disk.

- **Linux:** Use encrypted swap (`cryptsetup` or `dm-crypt`)
- **macOS:** Encrypted by default with FileVault
- **Windows:** BitLocker encrypts the entire volume including pagefile

## Known Limitations & Accepted Risks

### 1. SSH Trust-On-First-Use (TOFU)

All SSH connections use `StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new`. This automatically trusts the host key on first connection. A MITM attack during the very first SSH connection to a newly provisioned server would succeed silently.

**Why accepted:** Newly provisioned servers have unknown host keys — there is no known-good key to verify against. This is inherent to any server provisioning tool. Subsequent connections verify the stored key, so only the first connection is vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**
- Servers are provisioned via authenticated cloud provider APIs (HTTPS + API token), reducing the likelihood of a MITM during the narrow window between provision and first SSH connection.
- Set `KASTELL_STRICT_HOST_KEY=true` to reject unknown host keys entirely. This requires manual host key management but eliminates TOFU risk.

### 2. Health Checks Over HTTP

Coolify (`http://IP:8000`) and Dokploy (`http://IP:3000`) health checks use unencrypted HTTP. No sensitive data is sent — only an HTTP status code is checked.

**Why accepted:** Fresh Coolify/Dokploy installations only listen on HTTP. HTTPS requires a domain + SSL certificate, which is configured after initial setup via `kastell domain-set --ssl`.

**Mitigation:** When a domain is configured via `kastell domain add --domain example.com`, health checks automatically try HTTPS first, falling back to HTTP only if HTTPS fails. The domain is stored in the server record for persistent HTTPS health checks.

**Recommendation:** Always configure a domain with SSL for production access: `kastell domain add <server> --domain example.com`

### 3. API Token In-Memory Exposure

Provider API tokens are held as class properties in memory for the lifetime of the process.

**CLI mode (low risk):** Process runs for seconds, then exits. Token is freed with the process.

**MCP mode (elevated risk):** MCP server runs for hours. Token stays in memory and could theoretically be exposed via heap dump, core dump, or debugger attachment.

**Why accepted:** Node.js strings are immutable and managed by V8's garbage collector — there is no reliable way to zero a string in memory. Alternative approaches (Buffer-based token storage) would require changing all axios header construction and provide marginal benefit since `process.env` also holds the token in memory.

**Mitigations in place:**
- `sanitizedEnv()` strips tokens from all child process environments
- `stripSensitiveData()` removes Authorization headers from error objects
- Provider instances are not cached across MCP tool calls — each call creates a fresh instance, allowing GC to collect the previous one
- Tokens are never written to disk

**Future consideration:** Getter pattern that reads from `process.env` on each API call instead of storing as class property — reduces in-memory copies but does not eliminate the underlying exposure since `process.env` itself holds the value.

### 4. Remote Install Scripts

Coolify and Dokploy are installed via remote shell scripts downloaded over HTTPS. A compromised CDN or DNS hijack could serve a malicious install script.

**Why accepted:** This is the official installation method provided by both Coolify and Dokploy upstream projects. There are no published checksums to verify against.

**Mitigations in place:**
- HTTPS transport security (TLS certificate validation)
- Download-then-execute pattern (prevents partial execution on network interruption)
- **Script validation before execution:** Downloaded scripts are verified to start with a shebang (`#!`) and have a minimum size (>100 bytes) before being executed. A truncated, empty, or non-script response will be rejected.
- Install scripts are downloaded to `/tmp/` and cleaned up after execution
